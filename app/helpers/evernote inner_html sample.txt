on importing notes, we should:
normalise quotes and hyphens (prettify again before displaying - or just normalise into prettified)
replace above with simple image tag and caption (if available) - use caption as alt text
save images (with caption)
replace divs with p, then remove superfluous nesting
slideshows are done client-side by hiding inline images and gathering them up at top __SLIDESHOW
Use raw/template/cut paradigm

EXIF data is removed and map only shown if __SHOWMAPS is turned on in note.
